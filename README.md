ATAH – Intimacy with God Ministry is a God ordained movement birthed with one core mandate: to draw people into deep, personal, and unbroken communion with the Father. The name ATAH, meaning Intimacy with God, reflects our conviction that true transformation flows from closeness with Jesus — not religion, not routine, but relationship.
